# 1: Lab Setup

We'll break this down into the two options for setting up the lab: **Self-Hosted** and the **Managed Environment**.

## Self-Hosted

To complete the lab, you'll need the following:

1. [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com)
2. [Infected Webroot Files](https://whisperwolf.net/webroot.zip)
3. A web browser pointed to [https://siem.whisperwolf.net](https://siem.whisperwolf.net)

We'll be using VSCode as our text editor of choice in this lab. You can use any editor you like, but the examples will be in VSCode. 

If you download the files to your own Windows system, Windows Defender may alert on certain files (and spoil the lab). But don't worry; no _actual_ malware is in the infected webroot! Once downloaded, unzip the file.


## Managed Environment

We're excited to provide a new (experimental) lab environment for this village: a whole desktop environment accessible directly from your browser.

To request access to the lab, message **Michael Taggart** in the Village Slack channel. You'll be DMed a link and credentials to access your desktop environment, which will be available for 2 hours.

Your desktop has VSCode already installed, and the necessary webroot files are on the Desktop.

When the desktop loads, be sure to allow access to the clipboard!

Now, let's learn how to access and use the [SIEM](2-siem.md).
