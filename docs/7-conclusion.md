# 7: Conclusion

Congratulations on completing the investigation, defender! Believe it or not, this exercise was based on real-world compromises, following this exact attack pattern. And that obfuscated shell? This is a technique frequently used by real-world attackers against PHP sites like WordPress blogs.

With your notes in hand, try to answer the big questions from the beginning of the case:

1. When did the attack take place?
2. How did the attackers gain initial access to the site?
3. How did they establish persistence?
4. What were the attackers _unable_ to do?
5. What was the impact of the attack?
6. How could this have been prevented?

If you're interested, we've provided an [answers](8-answers.md) page you can check against your own work. We've included answers to the questions we asked along the way as well.
