# 4: Nginx Logs

This was a web compromise, which means the attack had to take place over, y'know, the web. WhisperWolf's WordPress site was served using the Nginx webserver, which our SIEM has logs for. Let's take a look at just the Nginx logs by selecting that dataset.

## Elastic Setup

In Elastic, find the the `data_stream.dataset` field in the field list (it should be right up top ðŸ˜‰). Click on it, the click the `+` next to the `nginx.access` dataset to select only those logs. 

Then, make sure we're looking at logs for the last `20` days.
In the timechart of events, one day should look a little larger. Make a note of it.

Let's get some useful columns. If we expand just one of th documents from this dataset, we'll see quite a few fields. The good stuff doesn't start until `h`. Using either the field list on the left, or the toggle buttons in the document itself, display these fields in our document list:

![column toggle](/img/elastic-http-toggle.png)

* `http.request.method`
* `http.request.referrer`
* `http.response.status_code`
* `source.ip`
* `url.path`
* `user_agent.original`

When you're done, your document list should look a little like this:

## Filtering Data

This is a webserver on the internet. There's going to be a TON of data we don't need. 

As a matter of fact, it looks like there's a lot of noise coming from the server itself. An examination of the `http.request.referrer` column shows quite a few requests from `http://127.0.0.1`. That's...unhelpful. Hover over one of those values and click the `-` to filter that value out of our results.

Check out the timechart now. Boy, that clarifies matters, huh?

**What day shows a major spike in HTTP requests?**

Click on that day to filter to just those requests. Your timechart will update to show events hourly.

**What hour shows a spike in HTTP requests?**

## Analyzing data

When investigating an incident like this, our first step is to look for anything anomalous. In **volumetric analysis**, we are simply looking for abnormal amounts of thingsâ€”in this case, HTTP requests. It sure looks like we found a blip!

This version of the timechart shows events in 10-minute bins. Click again. You should no longer see a single spike. You've found the large burst of activity.

**When did the activity burst start?**

**When did the activity burst end?**

Click and drag over the block of events to filter just to that time period. If you make a mistake, click back in your browser and try again.

### The Burstâ„¢

Your events are ordered newest-first. Click the `timestamp` column heading to flip it to ascending order (oldest-first).

Look carefully at the timestamps. Could a human being have been doing this?

Using filters, answer the following questions:

**How many requests for `wp-login.php` were there in this timeframe?**

**How many requests were NOT response code 200?**

**What is the source IP of these events?**

**With this information, what do you think is happening here?**

Hint: WordPress has a weird login quirk. Failed logins results in a response of `200`, but successes are redirected (`302`) to `wp-admin.php`.

## After the Burst

If, as we suspect, the attacker guessed the login password via a dictionary attack, their next steps once logged in will be crucial to understanding the investigation. Modify the view to look at what happened from our attacker's IP directly after the burst.

The admin dashboard has a lot of assets to request, making for a lot of `GET` noise. 

It would be common for an attacker to attempt to make changes at this point, which would require sending data to the server. That would be a `POST` or `PUT` request. Filter `GET`s out of your data and see what remains.

**What files appear to have been edited by the attacker?**

## Corroborating our Data

I know we're in the Nginx Logs section, but we now have specific files that have been referenced! See if you can find those files now in VS Code.

**What appears to have been added to these files?**

**What does this code do?**

## Filling in Gaps

Extend your time range a bitâ€”perhaps to 23:00. Take a look at the requests that come _after_ the ones we've already seen. Anything jump out at you?

**What new files are being requested?**

What daâ€”how did those get there? 

(You can see one of these in the webroot right now, but we'll tangle with that later.)

It really seems like _somehow_, the attacker was able to drop new files onto the system. That's weird though, because WordPress doesn't let you create new files through the admin dashboard; it only lets you modify existing filesâ€”as we've seen.

We're missing something.

Let's go back to what we know. What files were modified? Do we see them getting accessed?

Well...kinda. One of the files that was modified _doesn't_ return a `200` when visited. Let's examine those requests more closely.

**What is the url.path the attacker used to access the infected PHP?**

Okay so this is suspicious, but _as we're looking at things now_, we're still missing something. Let's pop open one of these events to look at _all_ the fields. 

I'd pay especial attention to the `url.*` fields.

If you find a field that seems to have more information, add it to our listed fields.

Whoah! Hello there. Looks like the attacker achieved remote code execution.

**What command did the attacker execute to create the first mystery file?**

## Zooming Out

Remove the HTTP Response Code filter you have on, if any. Let's move forward in time a bit.

It looks like toward the very end of the day, the attacker was mucking about in another part of the admin dashboard.

**What other action did the attacker undertake in the admin dashboard?**

Ah ha! This appears to be what the site administrator originally reported. Now, we could have gone looking for this firstâ€”and if we hadn't found anything via our initial investigation methods, we would have. But I always prefer to take the wide view first and see if I can arrive at the original evidence. I often discover much more by invesigating this way rather than starting at the end.

But we're not done. Oh no, far from it. Although this seems to be as far as the Nginx logs can take us, we have 2 other rich sources of information. Let's cross-reference the web activity with what was happening on the system with our [Syslog data](5-syslog.md).
